# SwiftDataStructures

Pure Swift implementations of useful data structures absent from the standard library.

Includes:

- `PriorityQueue`: a min- or max- priority queue

In alignment with Swift's standard library, all data structures are implemented as structs with copy-on-write optimisation. The by-reference versions with lower-level API are commonly available as `_[DataStructure]Impl`.
